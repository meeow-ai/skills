# meeow_skills

A public library of reusable Claude skills and agent templates — drop them into any project and skip the setup.

---

## What's a skill?

A skill is a plain Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that tells Claude how to run a specific workflow. Copy the file into your project, reference it in your system prompt or `CLAUDE.md`, and Claude knows what to do.

Each skill has a `trigger` field — a plain-English description of when to load it.
